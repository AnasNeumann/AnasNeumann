### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Anas Neumann. I have an MSc in software engineering and a PhD in business administration (which in practice meant optimization, simulation, and machine learning applied to industrial problems ^^) from [Laval University](https://www.ulaval.ca/) in Canada ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦. 

I'm currently a post-doc and deep-learning researcher at [Polytechnique MontrÃ©al](https://www.polymtl.ca/) and [Laval University](https://www.ulaval.ca/). 

I work with âœ¨**language models / NLP**âœ¨ (_HuggingFace, Transformers, LangChain, LoRA/QLoRA, etc._) to solve manufacturing issues and âœ¨**time-series models**âœ¨ (_LSTM, GRU, seq2seq, etc._) to help patients with type-1 diabetes. 

My new favorite research areas from a technical point of view are âœ¨**Graph Neural Networks**âœ¨, âœ¨**Deep Reinforcement Learning**âœ¨ (_PPO_), and âœ¨**Meta-Learning**âœ¨ (_MAML_). 

I participate in the creation of [CWCloud](https://cloud.comwork.io), discover more here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eLlmisM4dw&list=PLVa_2sL_l0msxUnmaSpLAGlwOxizXWjht](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eLlmisM4dw&list=PLVa_2sL_l0msxUnmaSpLAGlwOxizXWjht)

Besides, I'm also the lead dev of the [www.uprodit.com](https://www.uprodit.com)  web and mobile platform as well as the Genetic Algorithm-powered [www.i4evosim.com](https://www.i4evosim.com).
